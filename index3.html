                    <h1 style="font-size: 17px;">As much as I know kashish means attraction and honestly you behold that but for me kashish means a very cute person who is so understanding and smart that you never need to over explain , a person with great views and great taste.  Technically if I see our first meeting I would have never thought that one day I'll be writing this note but when I look back down the memory lane all I remember is that pmoment " when you gave me the chair and I wondered for days that who was that may gute girl " At that moment I would have but I wasn't a fool ☺ but I'm glad we took our time and came to kind of friendship . You are a wonderful person and would love to learn a lot from you and be with you till the time goes may you achieve all the things that you dreamed off have a beautiful future may God bless ❤
                        Once again a very happy birthday🎉
